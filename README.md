Attempts at learning how to interact with WinAPI with Rust, with objective of having a basic wrapper api built at the end.
Basic rules are, having to build everything ourselves... until we have an implementation that works.

Current goals:
- Improve public api:
    - Currently too many items are publicly accessible.
    - Public API has too many implementation details visible.
- Start converting already implemented things into windows library

Main things learnt so far:
- C interop
-
